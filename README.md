# Apex-Classes

##

Apex uses Java-like syntax and acts like database stored procedures.  Apex enables developers to add business logic to system events, such as button clicks, updates of related records, Visualforce pages, etc.

As a language, Apex is:
 * Hosted - Apex is saved, compiled, and executed on the server - the Force.com platform.
 * Automatically upgradeable - Because compiled code is stored as metadata in the platform, Apex is automatically upgraded as part of Salesforce releases.
 * Object oriented - Apex supports classes, interfaces and inheritance.
 * Strongly typed - Apex validates references to objects at compile time.
 * Multitenant aware - Because Apex runs in a multitenant platform, it guards closely against runaway cod by enforcing limits, which prevents code from monopolizing shared resources.
 * Integrated with the database - It is straightforward to access and manipulate records.  Apex provides direct access to records and their fields, and provides statements and query languages to manipulate those records.
 * Data focused - Apex provides transactional access to the database, allowing you to roll back operations.
 * Apex is based on Java idioms (a construction or expression of one language whose parts correspond to elements in another language).
 * Easy to test - Apex provides built-in support for unit test creation, execution, and code coverage.  Salesforce ensures that all custom Apex code works as expected by executing all unit tests prior to any platform upgrades.
 * Versioned - Custom Apex code can be saved against different versions of API.
